# Halalify App 📱🍽️  

**Halalify** is a mobile application designed to help users verify the halal status of food products by scanning barcodes or manually searching for items. With the rising demand for transparency in food consumption, particularly within Muslim communities, this app empowers users to make informed dietary choices quickly and efficiently.

## Key Features 🚀

- **Halal Status Verification**: Instantly determine if a food product is halal by scanning its barcode or searching manually.
- **Ingredient Analysis**: Cross-check product ingredients against a comprehensive list of non-halal items to ensure compliance with halal dietary laws.
- **Calorie Tracking**: View detailed nutritional information, including calorie content, for each product.
- **Personalized Food History**: Keep a history of scanned products to track your dietary habits and monitor your calorie intake.

## Target Audience 🎯

While primarily designed for Muslims who adhere to halal dietary laws, **Halalify** is also useful for:
- Individuals seeking healthier food options.
- Users who want a personal nutrition assistant to help maintain a balanced diet.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **Scan**: Use your phone's camera to scan the product barcode.
2. **Search**: Manually search for food items by name if the barcode is unavailable.
3. **Check**: Instantly see the halal status, ingredients, and nutritional information of the product.
4. **Track**: Save scanned items to your history and monitor your calorie intake.

## Limitations ⚠️
- The app relies on a custom-built list of non-halal ingredients and is not affiliated with any official halal certification body.
- Some niche products may lack ingredient data, leading to an "Unknown" status.
- Ambiguous ingredients may not be accurately flagged due to limitations in the cross-checking logic.

## Future Enhancements 🛠️
- Integration with official halal certification APIs.
- Expanding the ingredient database for better accuracy.
- Improved UI/UX for a seamless user experience.
